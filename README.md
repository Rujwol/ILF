# ILF

*The primary objective of this project was to build an interactive learning framework and few other secondary objectives are listed below: 
- To motivate students for better learning using elements of gamification
- To keep track of studentâ€™s progress
- To improve the interaction between teachers and students

The main aim was to find out about web page development.
The platform visual studio was used and C# was selected as primary programming language in the framework ASP.NET core2.2 and Vue.js was opted for front end design and scripting. 
With the plan to learn the basics of the software, framework and the programming language the project was started. 
As in ASP.NET core2.2 the basic concept of Model, View and Controller (MVC) was implemented.
Any code dealing with direct persistence to the database is considered the Model. 
View is where we see how the application looks like from the user's perspective, more like front end work is done here. 
The MVC architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers. 
This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using this pattern, user requests are routed to a Controller which is responsible for working with the Model to perform user actions and/or retrieve results of queries. 
The Controller chooses the View to display to the user, and provides it with any Model data it requires.

*Software Specification
